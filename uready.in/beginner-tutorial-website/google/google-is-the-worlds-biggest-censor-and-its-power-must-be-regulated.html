<div class="g-plusone" data-annotation="none" data-href="http://www.vetripandi.vetbossel.in/google/google-is-the-worlds-biggest-censor-and-its-power-must-be-regulated.html"></div>
	       <p style="margin-top:-10px">Google, Inc., isn't just the world's biggest purveyor of information; it is also the world's biggest censor.</p>
		   <p>The company maintains at least nine different blacklists that impact our lives, generally without input or authority from any outside advisory 
		   group, industry association or government agency. Google is not the only company suppressing content on the internet. Reddit has frequently been accused 
		   of banning postings on specific topics, and a recent report suggests that Facebook has been deleting conservative news stories from its newsfeed, a 
		   practice that might have a significant effect on public opinion - even on voting. Google, though, is currently the biggest bully on the block.</p>
		   <div><img src="../img/goog.jpg" style="margin-left:90px;margin-top:10px;"/></div>
		   <p>When Google's employees or algorithms decide to block our access to information about a news item, political candidate or business, opinions 
		   and votes can shift, reputations can be ruined and businesses can crash and burn. Because online censorship is entirely unregulated at the moment, 
		   victims have little or no recourse when they have been harmed. Eventually, authorities will almost certainly have to step in, just as they did when 
		   credit bureaus were regulated in 1970. The alternative would be to allow a large corporation to wield an especially destructive kind of power that 
		   should be exercised with great restraint and should belong only to the public: the power to shame or exclude.</p>
		   <p>If Google were just another mom-and-pop shop with a sign saying "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone," that would be one thing. 
		   But as the golden gateway to all knowledge, Google has rapidly become an essential in people's lives - nearly as essential as air or water. 
		   We don't let public utilities make arbitrary and secretive decisions about denying people services; we shouldn't let Google do so either.</p>
		   <p>Let's start with the most trivial blacklist and work our way up. I'll save the biggest and baddest - one the public knows virtually nothing 
		   about but that gives Google an almost obscene amount of power over our economic well-being until last.</p>
		   <h2>1.The autocomplete blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">This is a list of words and phrases that are excluded from the autocomplete feature in Google's search bar. 
		   The search bar instantly suggests multiple search options when you type words such as "democracy" or "watermelon," but it freezes when you 
		   type profanities, and, at times, it has frozen when people typed words like "torrent," "bisexual" and "penis." At this writing, it's freezing
		   when I type "clitoris." The autocomplete blacklist can also be used to protect or discredit political candidates.</p>
		   <h2>2.The Google Map blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">This list is a little more creepy, and if you are concerned about your privacy, it might be a good list to be on. 
		   The cameras of Google Earth and Google Maps have photographed your home for all to see. If you don't like that, "just move," Google's former 
		   CEO Eric Schmidt said. Google also maintains a list of properties it either blacks out or blurs out in its images. Some are probably military 
		   installations, some the residences of wealthy people, and some well, who knows? Martian pre-invasion enclaves? Google doesn't say.</p>
		   <h2>3.The YouTube blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">YouTube, which is owned by Google, allows users to flag inappropriate videos, at which point Google censors 
		   weigh in and sometimes remove them, but not, according to a recent report by Gizmodo, with any great consistency except perhaps when 
		   it comes to politics. Consistent with the company's strong and open support for liberal political candidates, Google employees seem 
		   far more apt to ban politically conservative videos than liberal ones.</p>
		   <h2>4.The Google account blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">A couple of years ago, Google consolidated a number of its products â€“ Gmail, Google Docs, Google+, 
		   YouTube, Google Wallet and others so you can access all of them through your one Google account. If you somehow violate Google's vague 
		   and intimidating terms of service agreement, you will join the ever-growing list of people who are shut out of their accounts, 
		   which means you'll lose access to all of these interconnected products.</p>
		   <h2>5.The Google Adsense blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">If your website has been approved by AdWords, you are eligible to sign up for Google AdSense, a system in which 
		   Google places ads for various products and services on your website. When people click on those ads, Google pays you. If you are good at 
		   driving traffic to your website, you can make millions of dollars a year running AdSense ads all without having any products or services 
		   of your own. Meanwhile, Google makes a net profit by charging the companies behind the ads for bringing them customers; 
		   this accounts for about 18 percent of Google's income.</p>
		   <h2>6.The Search Engine blacklist</h2>
		   <p style="margin-top:-10px">Google's ubiquitous search engine has indeed become the gateway to virtually all information, handling 90 percent 
		   of search in most countries. It dominates search because its index is so large: Google indexes more than 45 billion web pages; its next-biggest 
		   competitor, Microsoft's Bing, indexes a mere 14 billion, which helps to explain the poor quality of Bing's search results.</p>

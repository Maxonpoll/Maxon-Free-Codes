            <h1>The XPS 13 DE: Dell continues to build a reliable Linux lineage</h1>
	       <p style="margin-top:-10px">Hardware that ships with Linux installed isn't as rare as it used to be. System 76, Purism, ZaReason, and others have been cranking out hardware with 
		   Linux pre-installed for quite a while now. But while those of us who use Linux may know these companies, there's only one household name that currently 
		   ships laptops with Linux installed Dell.</p>
		   <div><img src="../img/dell.jpg" style="margin-left:70px;margin-top:10px;"/></div>
		   <p>Dell's Project Sputnik has been dedicating resources to creating a "just works" experience for Dell Ultrabooks running Ubuntu for nearly four years now.
		   Lead developer Barton George, who leads the effort, and other developers have been writing code where necessary (and contributing that code back 
		   upstream) and refining the user experience to a point where everything does indeed just work.</p>
		   <p>The original Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition had a few rough edges. Since that first device, I sat on the sidelines watching as George and Dell polished off those rough edges and
		    tweaked the hardware options to better meet the needs of developers. Over time, the team expanded the available RAM to 16GB, added a matte screen
			option (albeit only on the low-end model), and slimmed the dimensions down considerably.</p>
			<p>These changes all converge within the sixth iteration of the XPS 13 Developer Edition. Today, this might be the best supported Linux ultrabook on the
			market. Actually, it might still be one of the only officially supported Linux ultrabooks on the market.</p>
			<p>Before diving into the review, a little context: I'm a Linux user and have been using it full time since Ubuntu 9.04 was released. I split my time between writing
			(which I can do on pretty much any hardware), photography (Darktable and Gimp), and Web-based software development (Python, various Web servers, and sysadmin tasks).</p>
			<p>I've been using Linux off and on for long enough to have edited xorg.conf, have my own tweaked Xmodmap file, and to be all too familiar with audio and 
			video codecs. That is to say, I generally know my way around what used to be the somewhat torturous process of making Linux work on hardware that was 
			never intended to work with Linux. Currently, I dual boot Debian and OS X on a MacBook Pro, which took no small amount of tweaking to get working.</p>
			<p>I consider all of the problem solving and troubleshooting I've done to get Linux working on various pieces of hardware to be a learning experience, but 
			these days I no longer enjoy staying up until the predawn hours trying to figure out which @#$&ing Broadcom driver I need just to get online without an 
			ethernet cable.</p>

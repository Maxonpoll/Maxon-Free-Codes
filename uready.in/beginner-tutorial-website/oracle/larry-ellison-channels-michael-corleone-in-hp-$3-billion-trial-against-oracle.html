            <h1>Larry Ellison channels Michael Corleone in HP's $3 billion trial against Oracle</h1>
	       <p style="margin-top:-10px">Barzini was gunned down by a fake cop. Moe Green got shot in the eye. Several other bad guys were taken out in elevators, 
		   revolving doors and in their bedrooms. Tessio, played by the great Abe Vigoda, couldn't get Tom Hagen to get him off the hook "for old time's sake." 
		   Even Paolo, Michael's own brother-in-law, met his end courtesy of a garrote wire due to his lack of loyalty to the Corleone family.</p>
		   <div><img src="../img/larry.jpg" style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;"/></div>
		   <p>Michael liked to say none of it was personal. That it was all business. And on Wednesday, there was someone in a California Superior Court 
		   room who gave testimony that sounded, in tone at least, very similar to Michael Corleone.</p>
		   <p>That person was Larry Ellison. The Oracle chairman took the stand in the $3 billion suit that Hewlett-Packard is fighting against Oracle 
		   over what Hewlett-Packard claims was Oracle's efforts to kill off the Itanium semiconductor platform. Intel developed Itanium, and Hewlett-Packard 
		   banked on Oracle to provide software for Hewlett-Packard servers running on Itanium chips.</p>
		   <p>Just before Hewlett-Packard was set to start its 2011 shareholder meeting, Ellison, who at the time was Oracle's chief executive, put out a 
		   press release saying that Oracle would no longer give its support to Itanium. Hewlett-Packard said Ellison's decision caused so much 
		   damage to the growth of Itanium that it basically killed off the chip platform, and resulted in Hewlett-Packard wasting resources 
		   and losing out on so much business that it wants $3 billion from Oracle.</p>
		   <p>Ellison, however, tried to say that the move was nothing personal against Hewlett-Packard. According to Bloomberg, 
		   Ellison told the trial's jury that he made the decision because of what he saw from Itanium's creators at Intel.</p>
		   <p>"It was a business decision to stop investing in Itanium," Ellison testified. "Because the maker of the chip, Intel, had stopped investing in Itanium."</p>
		   <p>A judge in 2012 determined that, due to contract stipulations, Oracle was obligated to support Itanium by developing software for the chip platform. 
		   The jury in the case now is trying to determine if Oracle and Hewlett-Packard lived up to the terms of their agreement, and whether Oracle owes 
		   Hewlett-Packard any financial restitution.</p>
		   <p>Maybe it was just business for Oracle. But Hewlett-Packard must have taken Ellison's decision personally, or else it wouldn't be 
		   trying to get $3 billion out of Oracle's cash stash. No matter how much money is involved, it's hard to keep business from becoming personal. 
		   Plus the two companies have a history, what with Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd being HP's former CEO and Ellison being extremely critical of HP's ouster of Hurd.</p>
